# Introduction

Theming in Anchor is easy; all you need is some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS,
and [PHP](http://php.net). With our functions, it’s
a breeze making a theme.

## Getting started

The best point of reference is usually the default theme bundled with your
Anchor installation, since it’s always kept up to date, and it’s a fairly minimal
theme. Just duplicate the folder, remove the CSS, and adjust markup as needed.

Alternatively, you can check out some [themes](http://anchorthemes.com/) made by
the community, or create your own from scratch. It‘s up to you.
