# Custom Templates

When creating pages and articles you can also create custom templates to go
along with specific content.

When creating a new page take note of the slug you create and use this to
appaned to the template file name:

	http://mydomain.com/about-me

The custom template would map to:

	themes/default/page-about-me.php

This is also true for articles:

	http://mydomain.com/blog/hello-world

The custom article template would map to:

	themes/default/article-hello-world.php
