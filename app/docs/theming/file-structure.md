# File Structure

Anchor has a fairly loose file structure — you can have as many files and folders as
you want in your theme, as long as a few required theme files are present.

## Required theme files

If you don’t have these files, your theme won’t work properly, or just won’t show up
at all. It’s vital you have these files (at least).

#### `about.txt`

This text file holds the basic details about your theme. For example:

	Theme name: Default
	Description: This is the default, shiny theme for Anchor CMS.
	Author name: Visual Idiot
	Author site: http://visualidiot.com
	License: http://licence.visualidiot.com

#### `404.php`

When a post, page or article is not found, this template will be used.

#### `article.php`

The generic single post template. Used on single post/article pages.

<p class="note"><b>This template is customisable</b> You can have custom article templates
by appending the article slug to the file name, such as <code>article-this-is-my-article.php</code>.</p>

#### `page.php`

The generic page template.

<p class="note"><b>This template is customisable</b> You can also have custom page templates
by appending the page’s slug to the file name, such as <code>page-this-is-my-page.php</code>.</p>

#### `posts.php`

This is the blog listing (and usually the index) template for your site. Used in conjunction with [the loop](/docs/theming/the-loop) to show the latest posts.



#### `functions.php`

This is where you can customise fragments of content by placing your own helper functions
in this file and calling them in your templates.


## Optional theme files

#### `header.php`

The very first part of your theme. Included at the very start of every template, and
is used to start a HTML document (the `<!doctype HTML>` bit).

#### `footer.php`

The opposite to `header.php`; included at the end of every template, and is normally used
to close the document and insert any tracking/analytics code, or external JavaScript.

#### `search.php`

This template shows the results for a user’s search. Used in conjunction with [the loop](/docs/theming/the-loop) to show the search results.
