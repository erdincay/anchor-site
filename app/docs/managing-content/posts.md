Undoubtedly the most important part of Anchor, the posts interface lets you
add, remove, and edit any blog posts (or articles) in your Anchor blog.

## Creating/editing a post

To create a post, click the green “Create a new post” button. You’ll be greeted

The extra fields (excluding custom fields) are explained below.


#### Slug

The unique identifier and section of your blog’s URL that tells you about the post.
Useful for SEO and usability (or guessability).

<pre><span class="comment">http://mydomain.com/blog/</span><b>my-article-slug-example</b></pre>

#### Description

This is a short summary of your article which you can use in listing pages.

#### Status

By default, a post can have three statuses attached to it:

-	**Published** — publicly viewable and searchable.

-	**Draft** — private. Not viewable or searchable on your site. You do not need
 	to complete all required fields to save a draft article.

-	**Archived** — semi-private. Not searchable, but visible via direct URL
    (i.e guessing the slug).

#### Category (optional)

The category the content should be filed under.

#### Allow Comments (optional)

Choose whether or not to display the comment form (and comments) with the post.
This includes all prior comments

#### Custom CSS (optional)

Each article can have its own style, you can populate this with CSS code by
typing it in the input textarea, or if you already have your styles in a CSS
file, you can drag and drop anywhere on the create post page to populate it.

#### Custom JS (optional)

Each article also can have its own JavaScript, you can enter it typing it in the
input textarea or if you already a JavaScript file you can drag and drop anywhere
on the create post page to populate it.
